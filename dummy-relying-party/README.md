# Dummy Relying Party

This project builds a canister that provides a dummy relying party to request any kind of credentials.

One can access the frontend, login, enter the issuer and specifying which kind of credential and arguments need to be requested.

The frontend will then take care of performing the same operations as any other relying party will do and provide feedback on the result of the flow.
